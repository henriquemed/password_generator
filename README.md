# React + Vite

To run it on your machine you need to generate the node_modules folder after cloning the repository.
Run the following commands (assuming you have npm installed properly):
- npm install
- npm run dev
and follow the generated link with 'ctrl + click'

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
